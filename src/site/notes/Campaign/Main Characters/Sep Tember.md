# Story Overview
Sep is a failed actor/story teller who would do a one man show called "Tember's Tales" and use their Changeling ability to try and enhance the stories (though he has done a few shows with other people). There are two main reasons they never found success: They get into character which would lead to them scaring children or getting rough with the audience as "It's how the character would act". The other main reason is how he reacts to criticism, if someone didn't like a story or performance that would be a personal insult in Sep's mind and would often cause rows and bad reception. This has lead Sep to take the journey to the Sunless Citadel in hopes that he can join a party of adventures and make a name for himself and get people interested in his shows and performances

Sep is quite lonely but not by choice. Due to his arrogance and obsession with performing he finds it hard to befriend people Sep has one friend, [[Campaign/Other Characters/Backstory NPC's/Carrabell\|Carrabell]] though he calls her Bell, they met when they were young and they grew very close. She is Sep's biggest fan and best friend. She is actually the one that first suggested journeying to the sunless citadel. She said it would help him with is career but what she is really hoping that he would meet more people as she can tell the lack of appreciation and lonely is weighing him down despite what Sep says

He often carries around a performance kit (Disguise Kit) so that he can make outfits/costumes for the roles he plays

# Personality
Sep is quite loud and quite flamboyant when it comes to his speech and demeanour. Always being expressive and can often be seen playing up as if everyone is an audience

He’s always observing people’s mannerisms as he never knows when they will be in a story/performance, this is actually the reason for his rouge-ness from observing criminals for a more realistic story. He is also always looking for an opportunity to tell a story or play a part

Likes stews/soups quite a lot. All types from very meaty, to very veggie though he doesn’t like only one ingredient in soup

Sep is quite arrogant and thinks "he's all that" and can be quite overconfident and assured of himself

Sep is quite sour about the fact he's not as popular/appreciated as he would like. Often very defences when in question of skill and how well liked his performances are

Despite how close him and [[Campaign/Other Characters/Backstory NPC's/Carrabell\|Carrabell]] are, he is lonely, though he refuses to admit/acknowledge it.

Dislikes carrots, especially in stew or soup and doesn't understand why anyone would eat one
