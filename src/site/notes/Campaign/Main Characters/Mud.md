# Story Overview
Found by [[Campaign/Other Characters/Backstory NPC's/Hero\|Hero]] as a puppy mud grew up joining him on every adventure and battle. Muds bond with his owner grew so strong he was one day learned to speak common. After years of saving people the pair fought together in a big war (undecided which one), during an ambush in battle *name* mud was separated from his owner and after the war was over he never saw his hero again.

He now quests to try and find his lost friend, but keeps getting distracted by people needing help wherever he travels.
