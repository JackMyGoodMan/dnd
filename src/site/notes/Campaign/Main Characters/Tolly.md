# Story Overview
Tolly travels around searching for her family that she lost after a heavy snow storm. The family had a tradition of ringing bells to find each other in the snowy fogs of winter so Tolly searches around finding different types of bells traveling to new places and ringing all of them one by one hoping to one day hear a bell back. Although it hasn't worked yet the bells remind her of her family and bring her comfort. Tolly survives through her craftsmanship selling trinkets to strangers and taking crafting commissions. Everyone thanks her for her work but no one ever invites her in so she lives on outskirts of villages.
